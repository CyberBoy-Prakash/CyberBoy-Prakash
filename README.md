👋 Hi! I’m @CyberBoy-Prakash, a.k.a. the digital world’s knight in shining armor. By day, I'm a cybersecurity wizard in training at The University of Tampa with a glowing GPA of 3.57, and by night, I'm unearthing vulnerabilities across the cyber realm.

👀 Interested in? Everything cyber - from cracking codes with my Burp Suite wand to leading charge in the digital battlefield.

🌱 Currently learning? Advanced spells in cybersecurity at my Tampa mage tower (a.k.a. university) and preparing to conquer the OSCP realm.

💞️ Looking to collaborate on? Projects that need a hero. Got a digital dragon to slay? I'm your knight.

📫 How to reach me? Cast a spell to prakash.nadakuditi@gmail.com, navigate your ship to https://cyberboy.net, or send a raven to linkedin.com/in/prakashnadakuditi/.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His (or CyberBoy, the guardian of cyberspace).

⚡ Fun fact: I’ve been a cybersecurity gladiator, securing victories in CTF arenas and amassing a treasure trove of 50+ bounties. In the world of 1s and 0s, I’m on a quest for digital glory and a bit of mischief.

Let's embark on a cyber adventure together! 🚀
